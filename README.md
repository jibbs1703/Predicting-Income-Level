# Predicting-Income-Level

## Project Overview

In this project, an extensive exploratory data analysis of the Census Income Dataset of 1994 is done. In addition, we predict whether or not an individual's income exceeds $50K/yr based on the census data, extracted from the 1994 Census database by Barry Becker and Ronny Kohavi. The dataset was obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult).
